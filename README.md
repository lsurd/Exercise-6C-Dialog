*Project 6 Information:*
-From Mixamo I pulled the pesant girl model, as well as a sword swinging animation to interact with the setting
-I created textures utilizing bases from the previous maze assignement 
-The slime cubes are a re-color of the cheese texture with heightened metalic and smoothness to make them look shiny 
-The primary questline is to destroy all three slimes for the quest giver cube 
-The sword attached to the model is from the unity asset store and made by Alex Lusth
